-1,I bought both colors based on the reviews and really like the prints. however  they are too sheer. i don't want to wear a tank top  but you have to with these tops since they are so sheer. i can also see the fabric tearing easily  it is too delicate. i sent both colors back. what a waste because the prints and colors are good. these tops are also not for busty ladies. i have a big bust  and the top part didn't cover my entire bust and was awkward because the division between the fabrics would st,Blouses
-1,Wow this is huge! i'm all for the tent-look with the right style  but this was absurd. i could have fit two of me into the width  and with the peplum style  extra width doesn't flatter anyone. the fabric is also so thin that it doesn't hang nicely  it kind of floats around the body. if you want a wide top  then this is perfect  but if you wanted something that hangs nicely  look elsewhere. i purchased a petite s  my typical size.,Blouses
-1,The top ran too large and it made me look more bustier than i am and rounder in my midsection by how it fell on me. maybe would've been better for someone with a smaller bust. the quality of the fabric was just okay.,Blouses
-1,I ordered in blue. so excited at arrival; it looked gorgeous...then i tried it on! i'm 5'  106#  34d and my upper arms are a little muscular. i normally order 2p (sometimes 0p)...and never a problem. this top was sooo tight under the arms and at the upper arms...if i tried any movement would have probably ripped out the seams! maybe i just received a product that was mis-sized  or defective. all i can say  if you have skinny arms  you'll love it.,Blouses
-1,Sometimes i order things online that i can hardly wait to arrive  and then once they do  i wonder if i made a mistake when ordering it. this is one of those times  and it was not my mistake. the shirt i received is not like this one. it is an xs  but it is quite large falling inches below where this one hits on the model. everyone i have shown the shirt to says that it is a denim blue color  not grey at all. it is a pretty color  but not what i thought i was ordering. i hate it when this happens,Blouses
-1,"This blouse is so beautiful - the collar  sleeves  material...everything except the cut! it was like a tent. it needed to be more tapered  which would be easy to do while still maintaining the beautiful breezy flow  and be about two inches longer.    i had been drooling over this top for awhile and was so disappointed! please fix it and then i will buy again. i am 5'4""  140lbs and busty...a small was perfect  with the exception of the massive amount of material.",Blouses

0,It's really cute but seems expensive for the type of fabric. i thought it would be more substantial. got lots of compliments .,Blouses
0,This is such a cute design  but it's so short! it barely hits at my hips. you'd have to wear a layer under it to keep your tummy from being exposed. i'm also not thrilled with the buttons - i am a 34c bra size and the second button was gaping open on the size 4 top. i wish they'd been sewn shut - the neckline is so big  it's not like the buttons need to function. i got the burgundy with pink flowers and the colors are great. too bad it's so short and gapes open at the bust. going back.,Blouses
0,"My review of the pros : 1) quality made  not see through in any way  can wear with small bra straps 2) lace gives the top a 'different look""  really liked it. my review of the cons  which made me return the top 1) runs huge!!! i am 5'2""  36 small c  broad shoulders and my usual size medium looked like an xl. it was large in the bust area and almost 'puckered' at the armpits? i would probably order 2 sizes down to an xs  which i never wear in any size top. 2) for petite gals (i am 5'2"")  this a a",Blouses
0,I ordered my usual size and i think the length and the top (chest/arms) for great. however the bottom is more of a swing style than a straight or slight a-line as depicted in the stock photo. there is too much fabric in the stomach area and just not flattering.,Blouses
0,I like the tunic but there are no care instructions in the garment. if i wash it once and it shrinks or the dye runs it will be going back. please send care instructions.,Blouses
0,"I was initially drawn to the intricate floral design of the neutral motif. it looks huge and boxy  so i sized down to a 0- which ended up being too tight in the chest and arm holes (for reference  i'm 5'7""  130lbs  34a). i returned it for a size 2  which fit much better. in the end  i decided not to keep it because of the lack of shape  and it's a little unflattering for smaller busts. it does come with a matching cami and seems well-made  but it just wasn't for me.",Blouses
0,After seeing the picture online  i was coveting this top for a while and then retailer days happened! i immediately ordered it  but i'm still not sure if i'm going to keep it. i ordered a 2p (0p was sold out) and i was assuming it was going to be a little big  but i like flowy. the sleeves and chest are perfect but the top is cut so generously in the back (and it's a bit longer in the back as well) i feel like it looks like i'm wearing a wedding dress. i love it from the front. i'm going to try to,Blouses

1,"I ordered this shirt in each color and different sizes: petite  regular  ""my"" size  a size up and one down!  verdict: i ended up in regular size  not petite because i felt the petite was jsut that short and i could feel te cold breeze in the store. i could have gone in the 00  0  and 2 #2 is my usual size#  but ended up in a 0 only because it was less wide on me. it is  hwoevcer a tiny bit tighter around the back if i cross my arms forward #really  i don't do that move on a daily basis#. colr: i",Blouses
1,The only negative thing i have to say is that the color in person is different than the picture- it is much more of a coral pink than a rosy pink  which is fine just a tad unexpected! i ordered a size 8 and it fits perfectly (32ddd chest). the laser cut outs in the yoke add a very nice feminine  unique touch to an otherwise basic top. i can't wait to wear it!,Blouses
1,I love this top and was so happy when it came out in black! i'm typically an 8 on top and sized up to a 10  and it still feels slightly small across the shoulders and arms. it also requires a under tank because it's very sheer  even with the lining. worth it though!,Blouses
1,I just received this in the mail and must say its one of my favorite purchases in a long time from retailer. the navy polka dot color combo is classic yet fun with the orange. looks great on its own as well as under a cardy. this will be in heavy rotation.,Blouses
1,I knew i needed to have this shirt as soon as i saw it and luckily for me  it was already on sale. i read the other reviews and ordered a s (usually order xs or s  but went with s for this one because i was worried about the fit of the bust). overall the shirt is huge on me. i considered returning for an xs but suspect that would also be too big and maybe too short. i decided i could get it tailored instead for the cost of exchange shipping. so i will be doing that. otherwise i love everything a,Blouses
1,I bought the silvery blue tunic. it is very light grey with a hint of blue. it is so shapely - coverage without being boxy or maternity-like. it covers your bum perfectly and looks great with a dark pair of skinny jeans. the color can really take you through autumn  winter and even spring depending on where you live. i love the sleeve length  too.,Blouses
1,"I really like this blouse. it's hard to find a short sleeved button down that the sleeves don't stick out and look weird. this one does not have this problem. it is a bit sheer  but i don't mind wearing a cami with it. it is flowy... but not boxy/baggie. has a very nice  flattering drape. i'm 5'3""  110lbs.  32c  petite frame. the 00 regular fits great. i'm often a petite (especially in pants and long sleeved tops)... but went with the regular size here bc i wanted the longer length.",Blouses
1,"1. i'm 5'5"" tall  145 lbs  and 38 (36d) -32-40  and a solid size 10. the size 10 fit me perfectly  but if it shrank it would be too tight across the bust. the size 12 also fit me well but was an inch looser all around. the darts on the 12 hit me in exactly the right place  so i decided to go with the 12  even though it looks a little big. it makes me look smaller.    2. the fabric is a soft ivory color  and the fabric is soft but thick. it's not see through at all.     3. the lace on the sides a",Blouses

0,I ordered this dress after seeing it styled with a beautiful cape.  when it arrived  it was incredibly soft and the color was a pretty  muted pink.  however  once i put it on  it clinged to all the wrong places.  having a larger chest made it show a lot of cleavage and if i can't wear a standard bra with it  it's too complicated.  in a regular tank dress  it would have been a yes. overall a great dress  but probably for another body type.,Dresses
0,I was very excited about this dress but when it came i saw it had too much going on. it either needs the ruffle taken away ( my first choice) or the halter part taken away. in the end i think it needs to go back.,Dresses
0,Beautiful fabric  but the fit was off. the picture makes the dress appear fitted than it actually is. the belt is definitely needed  but would leave a lot of fabric in the back of the dress giving it a less than tailored look.     also  the arms and the top portion are a tad small  so if you have a larger bust/arms  this dress may be tricky. i am a 34b and the button in the xxsp was puckering a bit.i was really looking forward to this one for fall  but was no way for me to make it work.,Dresses
0,I looked forward to this dress.  it's a lovely design.  it's a heavy material that doesn't have the most flattering fit.  the green lace has snags along the hemlines which is a disappointment.  i'm returning the dress.,Dresses
0,I tried this dress on in the store today  and the armholes were so wide  it showed my bra under the arm almost to the bottom  and it showed part of the side cup of my bra at the front. while the dress seems like it will be really comfy  the arm cuts are so unnatural  i had to pass. i did try going down in size  and petite  and neither of those options worked to fix the situation.,Dresses
0,Cute dress to throw on and go. fits pretty true to size except for the slip underneath. it's a little tight and i felt to short for the dress. i ended up wearing a full slip i had under it and that work great!,Dresses

1,Love  love  love this dress! i needed a fun but not over the top dress for family pictures and this was perfect. great pop of color and looked amazing with over the knee boots. i see myself wearing this thru the holidays and will likely throw on with a jean jacket. i found it true to size - my normal size 4 fits me well. buy this dress - you won't regret it!,Dresses
1,"This dress is even prettier in person. i'm 5'5"" and usually a 4 in fit and flare dresses and got this in a 4. fits like a glove and hits right above my knee. the hook and eye closure does get caught on the delicate lace  so be careful of that. otherwise  this dress is perfect for summer weddings!",Dresses
1,Love this dress in the orange print! i do agree with one reviewer who said the high neck is bothersome--it is! but i'm willing to overlook that because it is the style of this dress. and it is adorable! easy and comfortable to wear--and i just love the orange pattern print! took my usual size!,Dresses
1,Received this dress for christmas and fell in love. the detail and fit is perfection. the buttons go all the way to the bottom of the skirt so no concern for pesky flyaway exposure should the wind blow. the detail on the arms w the buttons is also cute and i personally loved the longer sleeve that almost comes to my elbow - it's very flattering. overall a great little dress!,Dresses

1,I saw this in the sales rack and decided to try it on  and i'm so glad i did. it looks very ordinary on the hanger  but  in fact  it's a very surprising find  as others have mentioned. _____________ pros: - a-line so you could go down a size for a slimmer fit. - the zipper in the back has an attached pleather-like tag to help in zipping the dress up. i found this extremely considerate and smart; most dresses don't have this. - lots of stretch and very  very comfortable. i can see myself wearing,Dresses
1,This dress truly is a work of art and i am becoming a little obsessed with byron lars' clothing line. this is my 3rd dress by him and i have been a size 2 in the other dresses. the 2 does fit in this dress but it is a little snug. not sure if a 4 would look as good because it is meant to be form fitting. the panels trick the eye into making you look thinner too. my dimensions 32c 26 33. it fits perfectly in the hips and waist but is tight on top.,Dresses
1,Once i tried this dress on i understood why the pricepoint was so high! it's very thick ( but not uncomfortable) and very well made. love the color and style of this dress  but as others have said  the model picture is deceiving. try it on in store to see if you like it for yourself! i'm curvy on top and bottom with broad shoulders and personally it was a no for me  i found other dresses that i loved more  this one was pretty but wasn't a hit for me.,Dresses
-1,I love finding unique retailer pieces that don't require dry cleaning. i was excited to find this shirt  but it's not flattering. the bottom hem is a little tight  which makes the rest of the shirt look bulky. perhaps it would work better on people who have narrow hips. i also didn't like the pink tones when i saw the colors in person. i'll be returning this item.,Fine gauge
-1,The product looked more or less as expected  but the fabric felt very cheap. not the quality i would expect from retailer. the shirt is also very short  which did not bother me but is something others should be aware of.,Fine gauge
-1,Based on the strength of the other reviews  i thought this sweater would be amazing  but i was disappointed. the knit is very thin  cheap looking and weak that it won't last a season undamaged. it reminds me of a duster i bought 15 years ago at a discount fast-fashion retailer when i was a student. sloppy looking with lots of creases out of the package. collar is odd and the sleeve openings have an annoying flare. the drape is not structured enough--everything about this screams over priced bath,Fine gauge

-1,I wanted to love this tunic sweater. the material is so soft and a perfect weight. the color is pretty. bu the fit absolutely did not work for me. the tunic runs very small. a large usually fits me but i felt like i was wearing a small. the slits are quite high. i was sorry to do it but this one went straight back!,Fine gauge

-1,I also expected this sweater to have more bulk to it per the images. it is very thin as others have said. the design is awkward with the sleeve placement and that makes it more flowy vs. structured. it is more similar to a cape or shawl design. if you;'re looking for a warm cozy blanket sweater design  this is not it. i will keep it though as a layering piece and because of the sale price and classic color design.,Fine gauge
-1,Had to return this for a couple of reasons: 1) was too small! it's made like one of those tiny mittens that stretches to fit any size hand. i didn't bother to order a size up because i wasn't sure whether to go from a small to a medium or to a large. 2) the main color isn't grey  like the picture. it's a black and white checkered pattern. so  it doesn't look at all grey irl.    i'm still recommending because  if you get the right size  and like the colors  it will be a nice  light and comfy swea,Fine gauge
0,I like the look of this sweater and i am keeping it. however  i found the fit under the arms a little uncomfortable. there is a large seem that goes under the armpit and is a little bulky and irritating. also would not recommend if you are busty. because of how the stripes run  it looks stretched out over my chest.,Fine gauge

0,"I'm usually a small (5'5""  116 lbs  long torso)  but the x-small fit well. the black does look see-through in the pictures  but i figured i could wear a cami with it. it is see-through in person if you are up close  mainly in the back and arms since the front has extra fabric in places. however  it is rather short  possibly because it is an x-small  and i'll need a short cami to fit under it or will have to have a cami hanging out of the bottom  which drapes nicely and a cami may mar that effect",Fine gauge

0,When ordering this product  i thought it was strange that the mediums were sold out. i went with the small which is generally what i wear. however  these run small and i see why the medium ran out. they are pretty  however  i wish they made them more true to size.,Intimates
0,This is pretty and provides coverage with a bit of support for wearing around the house. i'm a 34b so i ordered the small- it still had room in it so i tightened the straps and used the tightest hooks on the back  and that makes it fit ok. i bought it just to wear at home since i was not expecting a great deal of support or shaping  and while it feels ok it is not super-comfy- it's a bit scratchy around the edges. i was going to buy another color if i loved this  but as it is i will keep the one,Intimates
0,I love and live in these but the recent scoop tanks i purchased were thin  not as great. so i want to recommend them because they are really versatile but the quality has deminished.,Intimates
1,This bra is beautiful. the lace is so lovely and soft and looks fabulous on. my only criticism is it runs very small. i am a 32 a and order the size 1 and it is snug... just order a size up (or two) and it should be perfect.,Intimates
1,I own a couple of pairs of natori hipsters and recently purchased the yellow to go with the front close natori bra. i tried to wear thong panties but they just didn't work for me. thankfully  natori makes these lovely panties that still make me feel sexy and they are way more comfortable. they also receive rave reviews from my husband. : ),Intimates
1,I'm not sure what cup size i am  36b or 36c  but the medium fits perfect. material is soft and stretchy. i usually wear a medium size shirt. i definitely won't be wearing it out in public  but i like it a lot for at home wear. the matching underwear may run large. i'm usually one size larger in bottoms than in tops  but the medium worked for those too.,Intimates

1,Yes  this is a thinner bra  it's almost sheer when you hold it up to the light  but it fit perfectly (36d) and is seamless under even the thinnest tops. i love that its not padded  i feel like it just slightly enhances my natural shape without adding anything more  and i really wish i had bought multiples before they sold out! i can't speak to how it will hold up since i just got it yesterday and i'm wearing it for the first time today  but i'm keeping my fingers crossed that it will last as wel,Intimates

0,I saw this jacket and loved the plaid and the idea of a soft sherpa material as a lining was hard to pass up1it was true to size and the material was very nice. however  the button closure was difficult as the buttonholes seemed a bit too small. also  the back of the jacket did not lay flat and it kept rolling.... i had to return this jacket.,Jackets
0,"I agree with a previous reviewer who said that it was very nicely cut  but unfortunately  the materials are so cheap. the ""fleece"" material that it is made out of feels like the cheap polyester fleece blankets that you get at the discount stores. it will pill easily  and is noticeable even in the dark color. i must have gotten one shipped straight from the store  and it was already starting to do some gnarly pilling. i do love the cut of it  but i can't justify keeping it because this won't last",Jackets
0,It is indeed cut to the shape of a trench. however  i think retailer should rename it as it's more like wearing a cardigan. it's soft and pretty which i like. however  i wasn't convinced to buy it since i have a gazillion long black cardigans already made out of the same jersey stretch material.,Jackets
0,Very pretty but runs tight - i usually wear an 8 or small/med in retailer jackets and couldn't zip up the 8 (am a 36c and thick/broad at the top) as there is no give. this is also more like a fitted shirt  made of lightweight muslin-like fabric. was looking for a summer jacket to wear over knits in a chilly  air conditioned office setting so sadly it didn't work for me. could be cute on someone with a smaller frame over a tank or cami.,Jackets
1,Love this blazer! combines a chic  pulled together look with super soft  comfortable material. will be great for the office and the weekend. runs a little big?am typically a large or xl  so i ordered the xl and had to exchange for a large. might have actually been able to size down to a medium  but didn't want to deal with the back and forth again.,Jackets
1,I really like this vest. personally  i think it is difficult to find vests that fit properly. this is a good one. fabric and color good. the photo is very representative of the color. no surprises there. arm holes are not too big which is often a problem. the detail on the back gives it some added interest. the only thing i would mention that could be a negative is that it is short  especially in the back. again the picture is representative but do pay attention to the length and be certain that,Jackets
1,I love the design of this cape. most capes are coats which can only be wore in the fall months here in the midwest since winter is too cold. this cape is more like a layering piece for indoors similar to a cardigan sweater  which i like. it can be wore in an office setting or out on the town with jeans. the constructions is well made as well,Jackets
1,I love this jacket. let's be clear though...it's not for warmth just for style but it's perfect for fall in california. i love the detailed work and have already tried this with so many different layers  a light blue tank  off white shirt  tshirt and it looks great with lots of things and truly makes the outfit. love unique pieces like this and i will be wearing it often. i bought my usual size small. sleeves are a bit long for my 5'4 frame but they didn't have in petite and it looks great.,Jackets
1,I dig this jacket very much because i can wear it like a thick shirt or as a jacket  and the removable collar gives even more versatility. i am short so i opted for regular xs (i'm 5ft2in  34b  26 waist  36 hips)  the bit of spandex stretch helps me achieve the fitted look without looking too tight. i love military green color  it's a happier neutral than black or brown. without saying  it goes with everything and flatters all body types.,Jackets

0,The fabric is super soft and the grey is pretty  but it is light grey not dark grey as described when you select to buy it. my biggest issue with the top is that the cold shoulder arm reveals the entire arm  so if you aren't completely toned with your tricep and all over arm  it will show... which is why i bought this to hide my blunders,Knits

0,"This spandex top  in my opinion  is workout wear. it is not the tank i expected to receive  but my bad. it is super stretchy tank like most folks use with leggings or workout shorts. it does seem small but perhaps due to the kind of tank it is  it should fit like this. 5' 5"" 142 lbs medium is skin tight. color is nice but  as i wanted a tank to wear with skirts or jeans and this is not what i had envisioned-it has to go back to retailer. quality seems fair.",Layering

-1,Let me start off by saying that i really  really wanted this jumpsuit to work as it looked good on me and was tts (got a 6p). unfortunately  it didn't work out due to the two buttons at the top which break way too easily. i had to return it and exchange for another jumpsuit but it did me no good as the second one did the very same thing so i didn't even bother trying it on. the buttons broke through before i even got the chance as the material is far too thin and the back of the buttons just pop,Pants

0,I love these pants -- bought them in the mustard color. my only complaint is that they are not colorfast -- i washed them in cold water with other colored items -- most of which belonged to my husband. not good -- and pretty much ruined an entire load of laundry except for these pants. retailer -- please color test your garments. there is really no excuse for fabrics like this to run in this day and age!,Pants
0,I have mixed feelings on these. i ordered the honey which is a mustard color as shown in the picture. they are true to size  cute  and comfortable. i washed them the first time with a load of darks and the color ran onto other clothes. plus the pants looked a little streaked in some areas. i'm not sure if this was a bad lot  but back to the store they went.,Pants

0,I love love love these pants!!! they actually fit me and look great!!!! buyer beware that the dye used is very delicate. i had a very slight stain on them that most likely only i noticed  but i decided to use a spray and wash stain remover. the resulting removal of the stain came with a very large loss of color anywhere the stain remover touched. unfortunately this has made these pants unwearable. buy  wear and wash these with care!!!,Pants
