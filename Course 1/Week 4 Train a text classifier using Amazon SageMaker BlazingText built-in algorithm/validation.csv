__label__-1 "i got the blue . it is very short . one side of the shirt i received was shorter that the other . the material feels cheap and pleats out a bit right over the bust - only flattering on small busted models ."
__label__0 "probably should have returned this but it 's just so pretty . i got complements from strangers the very first time i wore it but it 's extremely long . tucking it in will be tough-where do you put all that length ? aside from that it is beautiful . the embroidery is soft and delicate light blues gold neutrals . hard to see in the pic but there are textured polka dots all over the shirt . great buy-i just wonder how i 'll wear it or if the length will be too much and it will become a 'closet sitter ' ."
__label__1 "i love everything about this top ! the fabric the color the fit ! great top for spring and summer !"
__label__0 "the fabric feel and design of this dress is sooo cute but so large that sadly it will need to go back . beautiful and softly flowing design but so full that not flattering ."
__label__1 "i love this dress . i 've received compliments from everyone . it 's long enough to feel appropriate for work or teaching in sunday school - and it 's beautiful !"
__label__0 "i ordered this skirt because the 4 i tried on in store was huge and the 2 was way too small . the sizing was an issue so i thought i would try another 4. the skirt that arrived by mail was so wrinkled it was obvious that a day of wear would turn it into a nightmare of unflattering creases and stretched out areas . i like the concept of the design with the button front and a-line princess seams in the front and back but i just feel the fabric in this skirt has too much stretch . i returned it ."
__label__-1 "i love the look and feel of the material but it was way too short - i do n't even have a long torso ! sadly it 's going back to the store ."
__label__0 "bought this shirt because i loved the cut and the stripes . had little to no shape to it . some may think it runs big but it appears that is the look this top is going for . i feel like being short i just looked kind of dumpy on me . fabric is nice but borders on see through . it was just ok .... nothing exciting ."
__label__-1 "love this top ! but unfortunately i returned it for exchange coz it was too small for me . hoping there 's a sz sm in stock ."
__label__1 "this dress is very pretty and would be nice for a summer wedding . you will need to go braless or wear a strapless bra . i am sending it back because as it runs very small . i am a 34a and the size 2 was too snug across the top ."
__label__0 "i ordered these on sale despite a previous reviewer 's comment that they were unflattering on the back side . they really do hug your bum but that is not what bothers me . what bothers me is that the back side is totally see through so unless you plan on wearing them with a long top they are not wearable in public or around other people . i have gotten some of my favorite pieces from retailer but also some of the most poorly designed . unfortunately these fall in the latter category ."
__label__0 "this runs really large . i love it ! sold out of xs p and xxs p ... go figure : ( size down if you are slim ."
__label__0 "i am usually a size 2 in tops . i am very very rarely a size 0 so upon reading other reviews of this top i decided to order the 2 and assumed it would fit the way a 2 usually does . obviously this is designed to be a loose flowing top . that 's why i wanted to order it . however the 2 is simply too loose in every direction . my primary gripe is that the arm holes are gaping and falling at the side in a way i do n't think it intended . i do really like the styling and quality so i am planning on"
__label__0 "this dress is super cute - and fits tts for retailer . i ordered my usual size small and it fit me great everywhere however the arms are much shorter and hit me either wrong or the model in the picture is just very very small . i 'm 5'10 136 # 36aa slim built and the dress fits but the arms bunch up -- if i ordered a medium the entire dress would be too baggy ( and it is a loose fitting shift ) . bummer bc it is super cute ! also the material is loose crochet - my dress arrived with a pull . sad fa"

__label__0 "i buy pretty much every tiny top retailer carries and so of course i grabbed this one online . i would say size wise it 's consistent for tiny which in my opinion is in the runs small category as i 'm a large in basically every top ever except the tiiny brand where i always have to take an xl . anyway the print is beautiful but the neckline is strange- there is a very flimsy button keeping it tacked shut at the very top and if that snap pops open it 's open all the way down to the waist area where"

__label__-1 "i loved this top online but it arrived very wrinkled which raised a red flag as to how it would look after wearing it . seemed high maintenance . also did n't love the fit . color is vibrant but overall not a fan of this top ."
__label__0 "these are cute and light weight however the fit is off . i ordered my normal size large ( i 'm a 12/14. ) . the waist was large but fit ok. they were really tight across the theighs . the crop length is fine with my 5 ' 9 height . if i had n't got such a good sale of probably return them . they will be good lounge pants ."
__label__1 "the delicate print and coloring are stunning . i also like the length and fit and am really enjoying this dress . the key hole opening was a little low and showed my bra so i had to sew up the bottom inch i also agree with an earlier comment that a full lining would be nice . this is the first dress i have bought from retailer because i generally find dresses are too short and do not provide enough coverage at the top . i hope that future collections will include midi dresses and hemlines"
__label__0 "i was so excited to try this on -- but this was a big nope for me unfortunately . i ordered both an xs and s ( i normally wear a s ) both hung horribly on me they were just too big . i love a boxy oversized silhouette but this sadly did n't flatter me in the least ."

__label__0 "i had high hopes for this top as it looked great online . unfortunately it was much more ruffly in person and not my style at all . it was a lot of fabric and poofed out too much -- reminded me of a child 's top . sad to return it !"
__label__1 "i love these pants ! for reference i am 5 ' 1 1/2 and 104lbs . so definitely petite . i ordered the extra small petite- way too long and huge around the hips.- i checked to see if maybe they sent the wrong size . hemming would not have been a problem and i even considered having them altered - but it would have been too difficult with the pockets and the pleats . unfortunately they do not come in xxs p so sadly they are going back . order a size down ."
__label__1 "i got two of these when they went on sale because i hate paying $ 68 for a basic top like this .. but for the sale price they are great ! comfortable lightweight and flattering . the black is a little sheer but nothing a tank underneath ca n't solve . a good buy !"
__label__1 "i love this dress so much - the perfect summer dress . comfortable easy to travel with and i get compliments on it all the time !"

__label__0 "i read the reviews before i bought this dress and had trouble believing that the dress literally fell apart at the seams so i bought it . first the good : i love the color the fabric and the design . it 's very lightweight and loose-fitting and is perfect for hot days . the neck and sleeves are pretty on . i can wear it as a cover up or put on a necklace and sandals for everyday errands and things . now the bad : it literally falls apart at the seams as you take it out of the package ! im surprised a"

__label__0 "lovely palette and and fabric but the cut did not flatter my shape . the flowy cut broadened my silhouette and hit at my waist making me look bigger than i actually am . the overall effect was quite frumpy in spite of the flamboyant pattern . perhaps a better choice for someone built exactly like the model . i will be returning it ."
__label__1 "this is a beautiful dress that glides over your body and swishes around when you walk . i received many compliments when i wore this with black korkease platform sandals and peruvian opal jewelry . the fit is true to size i took my usual size l. it is longer on me than the model and my only complaint is the slip-it is very sheer and you can see your legs through the slip and the dress together so i had to find a different slip . i think retailer should also make their slips a bit longer i do n't"

__label__1 "this is such a comfy top and the fabric is really great . more supple / flowy than i expected . it does run larger than i expected . i typically wear a large and it 's almost more billowy than i would normally prefer . i would love to try a medium to see the difference but since it was purchased online i 'm just going with it . this will get lots of wear this season ."
__label__-1 "the photos online make it look like a comfortable relaxed lightweight early fall/spring cardigan . when it arrived it looked very wrinkly and there is no shimmer as far as i can tell . i tried using my steamer to get some of the wrinkles out but it did n't work . it looks too rumpled and i do n't want to wear something that looks like i just rolled out of bed ."

__label__-1 "usually an retailer dress in a large fits me perfectly however not this one . i am larger busted and this dress was way too tight on top . possibly better on smaller chests . the dress is cute and the rest of the fit was good . not for me could barely pull it down over the boobs . going back : ("
__label__1 "i am normally a size medium or small at retailer ( depending on the bust ) and could not even get the medium in this top past my neck . it runs very small . unfortunately the size large was not in stock for me to try . truthfully i might have needed the xl in this - it runs that small . for reference i am 5 ' 6 145 lbs 34dd . also the beading on the top i tried was coming loose and some was already missing . seems to be a common fault based on what other reviewers have said ."
__label__1 "the blue color is sublime - the material velvet iridescent cool - the fit is loose and not something to wear to show off your figure but it is has a cool swingy boho vibe that was what i was expecting ... add a cool shirt jacket to elevate it and give it more structure"
__label__1 "love the pattern on this lightweight cardigan and it is super flattering . i tried ordering the xs/s first because the next size up just sounded too big but i ultimately had to order up for more room in shoulders and length in arms though . i 'm hoping the m/l fits without too much spare fabric because it really is a great piece ."

( please make more ! ! ) however this shirt did n't work for me . i think it 's a matter of where your curves live . the shirt was true to size but my boobs meant i was showing more cleavage than the model and the top part felt more like a bib than embroidery . sad coz it is lovely and feels lovely on . probably a great shirt for different body types . would love to see more green clothing ...."

__label__0 "this immediately caught my eye in the neutral pattern and the fabric is actually quite nice . the fit is at least a size or two too large though with the bust being way too large for me even sizing down . my normal 4 was big everywhere and the 2 was still big in the chest but fit everywhere else . the belt is handy for cinching in some of the loose areas but the top section just did n't work for me . maybe better for someone better endowed ?"
__label__1 "loose fitting and comfortable without losing its shape . looks great on . the tie in front adds to the dress . i love to wear with tan knee-high boots ."
__label__-1 "i ordered a small but it was way to big . it was very soft ."
__label__1 "i love the print of this dress ; the deep blue really is striking . i agree with the other reviewers that it has no lining and therefore it 's hard to justify the price . i ca n't seem to part with it yet due to the lovely print and the off the shoulder style is romantic and flattering . still on the fence . . . it would be better as a sale piece ."
__label__1 "this tunic is a great way to wear the plaid trend right now without it being the traditional collared shirt . it 's fun comfortable and has great style . the first time i wore it i got tons of compliments ! i 'm 5 ' 8 and the back of the shirt goes to the back of my knees i usually wear a size 12 and the large fit great !"

__label__0 "lovely dress and looks great on me but with just my second time wearing this dress and reaching across my desk to pick something up i feel the elastic waistband snap . this dress is definitely my size and i have felt no tightness or discomfort in the midsection . i have bought cheaper clothes with better elastic waistbands and had them for years . now i will spend the rest of my day looking like i 'm wearing an orange sack . i 'm not pleased ."

__label__0 "i usually follow the boho look and this dress appealed to me immediately and it was in the color i wanted black . so excited to receive this as i knew i could wear it both as a dress and a tunic but that was not to be . the outfit consists of 2 elements : a tight fitting slip that fits awkwardly and does not give enough room in the bust nor waist areas and an overlay dress that is really quite pretty . but it too was too tight across the bust area which made the entire upper torso ill fitting . i n"

__label__0 "just be prepared : this is huge ! i looked hilarious in my normal 00p . this was in store luckily the the excellent personal stylist warned me . i also do n't think the colors are as good in person - bit dull . if it fits you it could be nice ."
__label__0 "i agree with the first reviewer . this dress is just ok ; nothing to write home about . if you need a throw on dress in a pinch it 's nice to have on hand but there are probably a lot of other retailer dresses that fit the bill that are better quality than this one . it is also very body conscious in the back . the material is a thin ribbed rayon - on the cheap side . overall it 's a comfortable piece but it 's more like a thin long-sleeve t-shirt rather than a quality dress . it would have been a gr"
__label__0 "this is a cute top but not worth the price in my opinion . i love the colors pattern and soft material used . however the fabric is quite thin and just not worth paying $ 58 ."

__label__-1 "i felt like this shirt cut me in the strangest way . the waistband is very fitted but there is so much extra fabric above and below it that it poofs out like crazy and made me look like a had a droopy chest and wider hips . it 's also see through . fit is tts ."

__label__1 "this shirt is wonderful ! i love the styling and the print . sure to be a favorite !"
__label__1 "a beautiful classic ! love the denim fabric in such a pretty style . this top has a more flattering fit than appears in the pics . the fabric is soft and the fit very flattering . ordered my usual size medium and fits perfectly ........ very true to size ."

__label__-1 "this dress is just too baggy overall . i am 5 ' 6 140 lbs and a size small was so unflattering . i ca n't go down in size because the waist detail will get too high on me . it was already a little high on the small ."
__label__-1 "does not look like the picture . lined with a cheap denim fabric inside that shows when arms are rolled up . i normally always fit in mediums and this jacket is so small in the arms as well as body that it fit like a xs ."
__label__0 "these pants are adorable as pajamas or maybe something very casual to wear to the beach but they honestly do not seem like something that a grown woman would wear in public . they are good quality and fit nicely but i feel like if you 're over 20 they 're not really flattering or especially appropriate ."
__label__1 "perfect fit . this dress is super flattering the criss-crossing fabric at the bust looks awesome on . the fabric is a little bit thicker through there which is nice for coverage . the skirt is light and airy and the pattern is so pretty ! the perfect spring to summer dress !"

__label__1 "i 'm 5 ' 5 120 lbs and i bought these in a 0. they fit great . i wore them for upwards of 12 hours and i was very comfortable . i received compliments on the print and cut . very flattering ."
__label__1 "while i have to agree with some other reviewers that this is not the most flattering coat ( as a size 12/14 with hips it does my hips no favors ) but the comfort and warmth make up for it . this coat is so soft it 's like wearing a puffy blanket . unlike typical puffer coats it does not have any kind of vinyl feel to it- but nor does it have any wind or water resistance at all . with all that said the comfort and cosy feel won me over . i 've received several compliments as well so maybe it 's more"
__label__-1 "i wanted to love this coat so bad . the material is lovely and it 's beautiful on the hanger but being tall and skinny is a must to pull it off . if you have any hips forget it ( my hips are 38 ) - you end up looking incredibly bottom heavy . the jacket also ran funny across the shoulders .... like the underarm was sewn low down the arm so arm movement was restricted it was weird . but it buttoned nicely without any pulling so it was n't a size thing . i bought a size medium at 5 ' 5 and 140 pounds ."
__label__0 "i was so excited to try out this top since it was such a bargain and neutral . unfortunately the shape is a line and accentuates the hip area a bit more than i find flattering . so it will be returned ."
__label__1 "love this shirt . tried it on in 2 of the colors and both were very flattering . the quality of the shirt is great . worth the price for sure !"
__label__0 "i like the idea of the pullover . the quality of is nice ; the material is very soft and feels pleasant to the touch . i expected this sweater to be more flattering though . it is true to size but the length is strange . it seems a bit too long yet is too short to look like a longer tunic . or maybe the waistline is a little low ... whatever it is it makes me look like i have short legs . also the collar wo n't stay down the way it is shown in the picture . but it may work better for someone wi"
__label__0 "there comes a point where i have to draw the line with things i purchase ... i ordered this as i did n't have a black skirt but thought ti was n't special enough do n't get me wrong it fits nicely and is comfortable but i was wowed . 0p or xs p fir perfectly 26.5 in waist and 115 lbs . if you want ta nice casual skirt the sale price is a good fir for the skirt just was n't enough for me : - )"

__label__-1 "i was very excited to find a fun and lightweight white dress for spring/summer . for the past two years i have found two of my favorite white dresses . the material that this dress is made out of did not look high quality at all . the fit looked more like that of an old nightgown . this dress has no shape to it although probably comfortable not flattering . i had high hopes for this dress and wish that it looked like it does in the picture in person ."

__label__0 "i love the style and the look of this sweater . i wanted to love it and keep it but could not because the itchiness was too much . the style looks so comfortable and easy going but it was not it was clingy around the waist and backside . for reference i am 5ft 4in and 128b and i ordered the small - the sleeves were too long on me not cool long like some other sweaters this season ."
__label__-1 "this would have been a cute top but the shoulder seams come halfway down the arm and give it a really weird shape . it looks smooth and fine on the model but in real life they stick out and make you look boxy . too bad !"

__label__0 "this top is really beautiful . the color is rich and the texture on the back is a unique touch . and i think it might have worked for me except that i could only find a m/l and it was just too big . i love drapey styles and think this top would have been just the right amount of drapey if i 'd been able to snag a smaller size . but the m/l looked like a teal sack so it 's going back ."

__label__0 "i am a large in knit tees . this is the first tee where the large was just too big . it kind of hung on me . the band across the back also hung down so all over it looked like it was just too big a size for me . the army green turned out to be not a flattering shade of green for me so i returned it . i liked the whole design a lot especially the front macrame part but for me it did not work at all . also too expensive for a tee ."
__label__1 "this is the most intricate delicate beautiful dress i have seen in a long time ! the pale blue coppery brown and dark purple tones are so complimentary of fair skin dark hair and light eyes . unfortunately my normal size was far too snug especially on my hips and this is now sold out . the fabric has no give so i would say with any curves size up if you can find this beauty . i 'm heartbroken to be returning it !"

__label__0 "i like the look of this sweater and i am keeping it . however i found the fit under the arms a little uncomfortable . there is a large seem that goes under the armpit and is a little bulky and irritating . also would not recommend if you are busty . because of how the stripes run it looks stretched out over my chest ."

__label__-1 "this top is very beautiful and the color is a dream but wow is it short ! i 'm 5 ' 8 and it barely hit the top of the waistband on my jeans . the fabric is oddly heavy and not light and airy like i expected . it seemed like an odd choice for a blouse . because of the seaming and gathered fabric at the top of this shirt i would n't recommend this to women who are busty/curvy on top . it made my chest look huge ! this styling may work for petite ladies but tall & curvy ladies beware ."

__label__-1 "i really loved the idea of this dress and thought it may be perfect for work with a pair of wedges . but the first thing that set me off was the color and the material . the color is more street sign yellow than a soft warm yellow . the fabric is a thin sheet like fabric that makes the yellow look even cheaper . i was anticipating a thicker shirt-like fabric . when i tried it on i liked the idea but the material and the color made me feel like i was wearing costume ... or a parachute . i will defin"

__label__-1 "i so wanted to love this suit . it was gorgeous - the color the quality the style but i am returning and can not recommend it . the sides need to be connected just a little bit higher and i think it would work but there is no way you could move around in this without things popping out in front . i mean it would be gorgeous to just lay there in the sun but i did n't feel like i could even walk safely and i am not well-endowed . very bummed but it 's going back ."
__label__-1 "i loved the cut and the stretch in the material made them comfortable however i found that the material was unflattering for thicker thighs because it tended to cling to the body . it would have been better with some sort of lining as it would have prevented the flimsy material from highlighting imperfections . bottom of pants are not hemmed so if you want a clean look you may not like the edges . these were returned immediately as it just did not work for me ."

__label__0 "just so i 'm clear the only reason i said it runs large is b/c of the top portion but the bottom or waist . loved this romper when i saw it online it was however too big in the top portion . the straps are adjustable but the back is too low for a bra and it gaps too much in the front unless you are standing straight all day . also b/c i 'm 5 ' 8 the small was just a tad too short definitely no bending ! i 'm 5 ' 8 tall 127lbs with an average size chest # 34c # i ordered a small and the bottom"
__label__-1 "i wanted to love this top but when i received the picture on the website is a dark charcoal almost black and the grey that you order is much much lighter grey . in addition this shirt is super boxy ... thus why the model probably is pinning her elbows to her side to bring the top in . going back disappointed ."
__label__1 "i bought this dress in store today in a size 4 i usually wear an 8 ( so i was thrilled ) the print and details are gorgeous but it 's a very wide swing dress there is a lot of fabric and it has no waist . i 'm going to wear this with a belt so it 's fine but the images online are a little misleading ."
__label__1 "i purchased the teal/blue and the color is striking . though i put true to size the decorative top is slightly tight around the bust . and the bottom too is fitted and not flowy . for a looser fit you may want to size up . for a more fitted look it is true to size ."
__label__0 "i 'm usually a small ( 5 ' 5 116 lbs long torso ) but the x-small fit well . the black does look see-through in the pictures but i figured i could wear a cami with it . it is see-through in person if you are up close mainly in the back and arms since the front has extra fabric in places . however it is rather short possibly because it is an x-small and i 'll need a short cami to fit under it or will have to have a cami hanging out of the bottom which drapes nicely and a cami may mar that effect"
__label__-1 "this dress is horrible . i ca n't believe they can get away with calling it a dress . it should have been called a tunic or shirt . it looks like it is a soft flowing dress made out of nice material from the pictures no way . it is made from sweatshirt material it is lifeless and is kind of stiff . it came to the top of my thighs . i ca n't find one nice thing to say about this dress and i do not recommend it . the picture does it so much more justice that it is worth ."
__label__-1 "i really liked this shirt the one time i got to wear it ... but when i washed it according to the directions on the tag it shrunk ! a lot ! the sleeves are now too tight and it is much shorter . thinking about returning it to the store but in any case i can not wear it again ."

__label__0 "i really liked this dress in so many ways . i 'm tall and pear-shaped so the flowy shape is great for me . however the deal-breaker was how the armholes were cut . it is n't that obvious in the photos but they are cut in around the bust in the front in a way that was really weird looking on me and it was too expensive to keep something that 's unflattering . too bad if they had just had a normal armhole it would have been a home run . lovely fabric and nice that it has pockets ."

__label__-1 "i agree with all of the reviews . the design and fit are wonderful if you can get it on. ! the buttons are a nightmare ! whoever made these clesrly sewed the loopholes on the buttons closed with no thought as how to open them or get them off . ridiculous ! they need to put a side zipper on this as i will probably check into since i really want to keep it . so so so disappointing"

__label__1 "i am a shopper .... i shop a lot . this is one of my favorite dresses of all time ! so unique and as others have said like a piece of art ! the fit is tight through the middle but that 's what makes it look so perfect . i wore with tall brown suede boots and got compliments from ken and women alike . i love it !"
__label__1 "this top is both cute and flattering . it is also soft and the colors are gorgeous . i highly recommend"
__label__-1 "i saw this dress and immediately started daydreaming about wearing it while honeymooning in italy along the amalfi coast or the cinque terre with my husband . and then i tried this dress on and immediately woke up . the cut is a disaster the quality is terrible and the dress just plain did n't work . the strips of elastic were sewn unevenly giving the appearance that there was one large breast and one non-existent breast . the neckline was so long that it had to have the elastic run over the outsi"
__label__0 "this dress is nice colors and well made but it 's just not the style for me . it almost fits frumpy . i 'm not sure that a belt would even make it look good . also being 5 ' 8 it is shorter than i 'd wear . i like at least touching top of the foot for a maxi ."
__label__0 "so i have n't actually tried this and i 'm sorry for the misleading star rating . i just wanted to get someone 's attention on the length . the photos show the dress draping with almost a train even with the model in platform heels but in the video the dress is about 2 inches off the floor . is it the model in the video that is extra tall ? someone help me out . this looks gorgeous but since it 's an online exclusive i wo n't be able to try it on at the store ."
__label__0 "this dress is n't as fitted as it looks on the model . it appear to be more of a shift dress . as gorgeous as the print and quality are it does n't look great on me . for reference i 'm 5 ' 5 105lbs and bought xs . for whatever reason the high neckline is n't flattering on me . i do personally think this dress is perfect if you have broad shoulders ."
__label__1 "i want to wear this skirt every day - it 's so much fun to wear and versatile and i just feel great wearing it ! can dress it up or down - it 's pretty darn fabulous ! i highly recommend it - you 'll be grateful and feel pretty !"
__label__1 "like all maeve tops of this nature i am absolutely in love ! maeve always has a cute spin on an otherwise basic top . this top looks great with jeans shorts skirts etc . i purchased it in all 3 colors . the blue is more of a robins egg blue the orange is a great tangerine color ( perfect for us tennessee fans ! ) and the ivory is a wonderful brownish-white . the ivory is my favorite because it 's a very unique color .. i have a ton of white and ivory tops but i do not have one in a color like this"
__label__1 "fits great and just as pictured . the material is very smooth and slinky ."
__label__-1 "this top is beautiful in design but sadly i will be returning . it is hand wash and even after doing so i had 2 unraveled threads resulting in large holes . unfortunate since it was so flattering before washing ."
__label__-1 "i am a pretty curvy girl and thought the m/l was gigantic . i returned and was afraid to exchange for the smaller size thinking it would pbly be very large as well . it was not flattering because it was so boxy ."
__label__0 "this cute dress was very nice on . however my only reservations were the thickness in the arm sleeves . the dress has this thick curtain like material on the sleeves that seemed to big and cut way to wide for my skinny arms . i thought about bringing this to the tailor but i feel it would be a lot of work and the bulkiness of the arms would just be the same . other than that the colors and dress are beautiful ."
__label__-1 "these pants are gorgeous when you first see them . they fit beautifully when you first put them on . and then you wear them for one day . and they snag . on everything . and little strings start to come out of the pants . and the hem begins to unravel . and the pants which were once beautiful light summer pants appropriate for work or brunch are now frumpy worn out pants with a million snags and strings hanging off of them .... after one day . i ca n't begin to tell you how annoyed i am that i spent"
__label__0 "the blouse was not flattering on me . it would be for someone with a straight slim body type it falls mid hips and so it accentuates my hips making them look larger . it 's flared so it can not really be tucked in ."
__label__1 "i am 5 feet and 120. i ordered a petite small in moss . i have posted a photo below . it 's a pretty green . the lining is pretty . the reason i deducted a star is because the lining is very thin and slips a little when putting the jacket on . but it does n't effect the way the jacket falls and i wear it comfortably . it 's floppy but not sloppy . i was surprised that each side the fabric is like a tulip . it was a nice surprise . i 'm curvy and busty . i have zero problem with it being unflattering . the s"
